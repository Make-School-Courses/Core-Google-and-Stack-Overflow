# Core - Google and Stack Overflow

Using the internet to search for answers to problems is a tool
essential to everyone's success. This discussion covers Google 
and Stackoverflow. 

While you may be familiar with Google and Stackoverflow the 
material here may supplement your knowledgeor surprise you. 

**Theory and Knowledge**

## Google 

How do you use Google? Do you rely on the top search results?

https://www.wired.com/2011/11/st_thompson_searchresults

**While google is really good, and provides the best available 
search results you should always be assessing the results.**

When you search these are questions you should be asking: 

- How accurately do these results match the answer I'm looking for?
- How credible/knowledgeable is the source?
  - When was this answer published?
  
When the results are not as accurate as you would like look 
closely at the search terms you have used and think of how 
you can refine them for better results.

These tactics can help:

- Remove unneccessary words
- Refining terms
- Rephrasing the question

**Keep searching**, while Google is very good at what it does **sometimes 
the first set of results will not be what you are looking for**. 

### Google more effectively

Use effective keywords. The more descriptive you can be 
the better your results.

**Exercise:**

Search for the following listed terms. 

Google matches key words:

- A who
- The Who
- Who

Order matters:

- Sky Blue 
- Blue Sky

**Discussion**

Search terms and order of search terms.

**Exercise** Pair and Share

Take a look at this article and discuss it with your partner.

### On searching error messages

When confronted with an error message you'll need to identify the 
section that best describes the error. Usually the best 
information will at the top of an error. 

Many times part of the error will contain identifiers that you 
have created these may not be relevant. 

**Exercise**

Examine the error message below and pick out the most effective search terms. 

```

available in a protocol or as the result of a method in a class; did you mean 'Person'?
    static func ==(lhs: Self, rhs: Self) -> Bool {

                        Person

error: Equatable.playground:5:36: error: 'Self' is only available in a protocol or 
as the result of a method in a class; did you mean 'Person'?
    static func ==(lhs: Self, rhs: Self) -> Bool {

**Exercise**

Imagine you have to solve a problem and need to search for information
that will help. 

Try these searches. Imagine you want to randomize an array of 
objects and you need the process to be as unpredicatble as possible. 

Split into teams, each team searches for one of the ideas below. 

1. Learn how to rearrange the elements of an collection?
2. Understand how random are random numbers?
3. Get maximum randomness out of random numbers?
4. Find a service that delivers very random numbers?

### Google Utilities

Google has a bunch of built in utilities. Some of these are fun diversions 
while others are truly useful tools. 

1. Definition
1. Calculator
1. Timer
1. Conversions
1. Translations

### The Most important point

Google has done a great job making the Google search engine an amazingly 
easy tool to use. Look at it closely. There tool is not an accident, it 
has evolved and improved over time. 

**Discussion**

Final thoughts and discusion on Google, search, and terms. 

## Stack Overflow: Knowledge Base

Anyone who has a question about software development has seen answers to 
common questions on Stackoverflow. This discussion will take a closer look
at Stackoverflow. 

Here is how Stackoverflow describes themselves:

> Stack Overflow is a question and answer site for professional and enthusiast 
> programmers. It's built and run by you as part of the Stack Exchange network of 
> Q&A sites. With your help, we're working together to build a library of detailed 
> answers to every question about programming.

**Stack Overflow is a great place to find answers.**

There are Stack Exchanges for almost every topic.

- https://stackexchange.com/sites

Look at the stack exachanges for things that you enjoy that aren't necessarily 
software related. 

**Exercise**

Look through the Stack Exchanges for things that interest you. 

### Tour Stack Overflow

- https://stackoverflow.com/tour

**Reputation**

Stackoverflow is a good place to build a reputation. This is good for 
_job applications_. 

**Things to avoid**

People can be snarky. Ignore rude behavior if you encounter it. 
do not take any conversation on the internet personally. 

Remember! While diamonds last a life time the internet is forever!

**What to look for when reading a question**

Look for questions that outline and describe a specific question or
problem. 

Look for things the post may have already tried. 

Look for code samples.

**What to look for in an answer** 

Besides the answer read the comments. 

Look for code samples. 

**When asking questions:**

  - Write a clear description. Short and to the point. 
  avoid unnecessary language. Strive for terse but accurate. 
  - Include solutions that you have tried already. 
  - Include only the relevent portion of any error messages. 
    - Format the errors. 
  - Include a code snippet. Use Stack Overflow's formmatting. 
  - Proof read your work before submitting. 
  
**When answering questions:**

  - Write a clear and intelligable answer. 
    - Avoid trying to sound smug or snarky.
  - Avoid extraneous language. 
  - Use formmatting. Especially for code samples. 
  - Answer your own questions when you can. 
  
The most imporant thing to remember when using Stackoverflow 
is to **be profesional**. 

### Developer Survey

Stack Overflow provides a great look into the world of developers. 
This is a survey of developers on Stackoverflow that covers a 
wide range of metrics. The information is informative and interesting. 

- https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2017

What are some outstanding facts? 

**Exercise** 

Read the developer survey. Look for interesting facts and statistics 
that interest you or that may have an effect on your future.

**Discuss**

Discuss the developer survey. 
  
### Developer story 

Stackoverflow provides a service called Developer Story. This 
acts as an online resume for developers. Consider joining and 
using it to track your progress and work.

### After Class

**Challenges**

1. Make an account on Stack Overflow. 
2. Search for a solution to the random array? 
  - Add a comment. 
  - Up vote the answer you agree is best. 
3. Ask a question. 
  - Think of a question you had this week. 
  - Post the question. 
    - Notice the question may already exist! The site suggests existing questions. 
    - Explain your question as clearly and concisely as you can.

  - Format your answer. 
  - Write a good answer. Keep it clear and concise. 

**Stretch Challenges**

- Try and increase your Reputation on Stackoverflow (you need to post, comment, and answer questions) 
- Earn a badge
  - How many badges can you earn in a week. 
- Start a StackoverFlow Developer Story. 
  - https://stackoverflow.com/users/story/join
